This folder contains the three public group catalogues obtained in the UDS, UltraVISTA and VIDEO survey regions. 
Groups were detected with the DETECTIFz algorithm with the parameters detailed in DETECTIFz paper I.

These catalogues contain all groups detected with S/N > 1.5 in the range 0.1 < z < 3.15. 

We included several group properties such as position, redshift , S/N, R200, total_stellar_mass, richness. 
Please refer to the paper for more details on these quantities.
